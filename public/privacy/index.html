  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> April 9, 2025</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Brainy Voyage ("we", "our", or "us") handles data in connection with our Instagram automation tool.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>We do not collect or store personal data from users. When you authenticate with Facebook/Instagram, the permissions we request are only used to perform actions on your behalf such as replying to comments or sending messages. All actions are performed via Meta's official Graph API.</p>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <p>All data retrieved using the Instagram and Facebook Graph API is used exclusively to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Detect comments on Instagram posts or reels</li>
    <li>Reply to users based on specific keywords</li>
    <li>Check if a user is following your account</li>
    <li>Send messages based on user interaction</li>
  </ul>

  <p>We do not use this data for any purpose other than the automation features described above.</p>

  <h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not share, sell, or rent your data to third parties. All actions are contained within the authenticated session and follow Facebook and Instagramâ€™s data handling policies.</p>

  <h2>4. Security</h2>
  <p>We take reasonable precautions to protect your data from unauthorized access or disclosure. However, as we do not store your data, security risks are minimized.</p>

  <h2>5. Your Rights</h2>
  <p>Since we do not collect or store personal data, there is no stored information to access or delete. If you have questions about data access or usage, feel free to contact us.</p>

  <p>This tool integrates with services provided by Meta Platforms, Inc. (Facebook and Instagram). Please refer to their <a href="https://www.facebook.com/policy.php" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a> for more details.</p>
